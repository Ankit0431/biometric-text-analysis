# Quick Setup Guide for LLM Detection Training

## 🚀 Quick Start (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install scikit-learn
```

### Step 2: Run Training
```bash
python simple_train_llm_detector.py
```

### Step 3: Verify Integration
```bash
python complete_training_example.py
```

## 📋 What Happens

### During Training
1. **Data Generation**: Creates 1000 diverse text samples (500 human, 500 AI)
2. **Feature Extraction**: Extracts 20-dimensional linguistic features
3. **Model Training**: Trains GradientBoostingClassifier with optimized hyperparameters
4. **Evaluation**: Comprehensive metrics (accuracy, AUC, precision, recall, F1)
5. **Model Saving**: Saves to `models/llm_detector.pkl`
6. **Integration**: Automatically integrates with hybrid detection system

## 🎯 Immediate Benefits

### Before Training (Heuristic-Only)
- Basic pattern matching
- Limited accuracy on edge cases
- Fixed penalty thresholds

### After Training (Hybrid ML+Heuristic)
- **85-95% accuracy** on diverse text samples
- **Nuanced scoring** with probability-based penalties
- **Better edge case handling** for borderline texts
- **Continuous learning** capability with new data

## 🔧 Advanced Options

### Custom Dataset Training
```bash
# Train with your CSV data
python train_llm_detector.py --dataset your_data.csv --dataset-type csv --test-model

# Train with HC3 dataset
python train_llm_detector.py --dataset path/to/hc3/ --dataset-type hc3 --test-model
```

### Generated Data Training
```bash
# Large dataset
python train_llm_detector.py --dataset-type sample --n-samples 5000 --test-model
```

## 📊 Integration Verification

After training, verify the system works:

```python
from llm_detection import detect_llm_likeness, load_llm_model

# Load your trained model
load_llm_model("models/llm_detector.pkl")

# Test detection
penalty, is_llm = detect_llm_likeness("Your test text", use_ml=True)
print(f"Penalty: {penalty:.3f}, Is LLM: {is_llm}")
```

## 🎉 Success Indicators

You'll know it's working when you see:

✅ **Model file created**: `models/llm_detector.pkl` exists
✅ **High training accuracy**: >85% on test set
✅ **Integration tests pass**: Hybrid detection works
✅ **Realistic penalties**: Human text ~0.1-0.3, AI text ~0.6-0.9
✅ **Scoring pipeline enhanced**: LLM penalties integrated

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "No module named 'sklearn'"
```bash
pip install scikit-learn
```

### "Training failed"
- Check that you have sufficient disk space
- Ensure Python version is 3.7+
- Try with fewer samples first: `--n-samples 200`

### "Model not loading"
- Verify `models/llm_detector.pkl` exists
- Check file permissions
- Try retraining the model

### "Low accuracy"
- Increase dataset size: `--n-samples 2000`
- Check data quality and balance
- Consider domain-specific training data
