LLM Detection Training Demonstration

This script demonstrates how the LLM detection model training works
without requiring scikit-learn to be installed. It shows the complete
training pipeline including data generation, feature extraction, and
integration with the existing hybrid detection system.

Run this to see how the training process works!
